                    As a Computer Science major at NYU and a former software engineer, I understand that programmers need clear, concise documentation.

            <h3>EBM Installation Guide</h3>            
            <p><b>Client:</b> Shakespeare & Co.</p>
            <p><b>Project:</b> Engineer Installation Guide</p>
            <p><b>Date:</b> 2019</p>           
            <p>The Espresso Book Machine (EBM) is a book printer which allows bookstore customers to have their own PDFs, or those from a catalog, printed on-demand into bound hard copies. I was hired on to update legacy code to run on modern MacOS, as well as to document the existing codebase. This guide is meant for future software engineers who are comfortable with command-line but may not be used to the EBM, MacOS, or the languages and plugins used by the system.</p>
            <p>This guide was originally written in Markdown.</p>

            <h3>Introduction to Programmatic Advertising</h3>
            <p><b>Client:</b> N/A</p>
            <p><b>Project:</b> Article</p>
            <p><b>Date:</b> 2024 </p>
            <p>While interviewing for a potential position at an advertising agency, I was asked to research the concept of Programmatic Advertising on my own and come up with an introductory/persuasive article as a sample. While I did not get the position, I think the resulting article is a suitable example of my ability to research and distill ideas under time pressure. </p>

            <h3>Squishy Toy Tutorial</h3>
            <p><b>Client:</b> N/A</p>
            <p><b>Project:</b> Crafting Tutorial </p>
            <p><b>Date:</b> 2024 </p>
            <p>I am an artist in my spare time, and one thing I make and sell is silicone rubber stress "squishy toys". Some of my customers have asked how I make them. I made this tutorial to have something to point to when people have questions. It is meant for other artists who have some sculpting ability but are not familiar with using silicone or making molds.</p>
